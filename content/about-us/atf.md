Active Transport Futures develops and provides globally scalable software to aid
cities to plan futures in which active transport such as walking and cycling play
increasingly prominent roles. Our tools use open sources of data with global
coverage, and can be minimally implemented independent of the availability of
local data. Where no local data are available, tools are calibrated using global
data sets (see [Data](../data)); locally provided data can readily be
implemented to ensure appropriate calibration to local needs and behaviours.

A major focus of current work is a project being conducted in conjunction with
the World Health Organization, for which we are developing a [prototype
tool](../who1) to aid planning active transport futures in Accra, Ghana, and
Kathmandu, Nepal.

Our primary source of data is [Open Street Map](https://openstreetmap.org),
accessed via our own [**R** package
`osmdata`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata), with tools constructed using our
extremely efficient and scalable routing engine
[`dodgr`](https://atfutures.github.io/dodgr/)  (Distances on Directed Graphs in
R).
