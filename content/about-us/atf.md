Active Transport Futures develops and provides globally scalable software to aid
cities to plan futures in which active transport such as walking and cycling play
increasingly prominent roles. Our tools use open sources of data with global
coverage and aim to be globally applicable independent of the availability of
local data.

This work is currently being developed in conjunction with the World Health
Organization, for which we are developing a [prototype tool](../who1) to aid planning
active transport futures in Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal.

Our primary source of data is [Open Street Map](https://openstreetmap.org),
accessed via our own [**R** package
`osmdata`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata), with tools constructed using our
extremely efficient and scalable routing engine
[`dodgr`](https://atfutures.github.io/dodgr/)  (Distances on Directed Graphs in
R).
