# The data we use

Our global-scale analyses rely primarily on data for street networks from [Open
Street Map (OSM)](https://openstreetmap.org), population densities from
[worldpop](http://www.worldpop.org.uk), and additional behaviour data used for
model calibration from the [Integrated Public Use Microdata
Series](https://www.ipums.org/), hosted by the Minnesota Population Center at
Minnesota University, U.S.A.  Local applications are generally supplemented by
additional data used to calibrate models to reflect local characteristics and
behavioural patterns.

## Open Data Policy

Active Transport Futures has an exclusive open data policy in order to

1. Ensure reproducibility of all results; and
2. Ensure that cities can themselves adapt and learn from the results obtained
   from other cities.
