# The data we use

We rely primarily on data for street networks from [Open Street Map
(OSM)](https://openstreetmap.org) and for population densities from
[worldpop](http://www.worldpop.org.uk). Additional data used to calibrate
global-scale models are obtained from the [Integrated Public Use Microdata
Series](https://www.ipums.org/), hosted by the Minnesota Population Center at
Minnesota University, U.S.A.
