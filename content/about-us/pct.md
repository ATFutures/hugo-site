## The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT)

The Active Transport Toolkit builds on our expertise developing the
Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT).
This is an online, interactive mapping tool to help decide where to prioritise
new cycling infrastructure ([Lovelace et al. 2017](http://www.jstor.org/stable/26211742)).
It's publicly accessible at [pct.bike](http://www.pct.bike/) where you can test out it's functionality by clicking on a region.

The PCT is being used by dozens of local authorities across England to develop strategic cycling networks.
However it has limitations which mean a new approach is needed for internationally scalable tools:

- Relies on origin-destination data which are a) often unavailable and b) have low geographic resolution.
- Only includes single mode trips, does not include travel to public transport.
- Cycling-specific, does not include walking.

A follow-on project the Cycling Infrastructure Prioritization
Toolkit ([CyIPT](https://www.cyipt.bike/)).
Team member Robin Lovelace was the lead developer of the PCT and Principal Investigator of the CyIPT.
