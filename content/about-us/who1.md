Active Transport Futures Software is used by the World Health Organization (WHO)
as part of their [Urban Health
Initiative](http://www.who.int/topics/urban_health/en). An important focus for
the WHO is understanding how, when, where, and why people move throughout
cities.  We are currently developing a prototype tool to aid the cities of
Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal, to effectively plan active transport
futures. Examples of our tool in action can be seen in [this interactive map of
'first mile' pedestrian flows from towards bus
stops](https://atfutures.github.io/accra-flows-ped-to-bus/index.html), and the
equivalent ['last mile' flows from bus
stops](https://atfutures.github.io/accra-flows-ped-from-bus/index.html). Those
are flows to and from every single point in the Accra street network
respectively from and to every single bus stop.

These flows are then linked with the WHO's [Health Economic Assessment
Tool](http://heatwalkingcycling.org/#homepage) to yield spatially,
demographically, and behaviourally explicit insight into the health and economic
impacts of current and project patterns of active transport.

The project is developed as an entirely open and repeatable
[`github` repository](https://github.com/ATFutures/who), with the initial
report available
[here](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/who-active-travel-tool-feasibility/README.html).
