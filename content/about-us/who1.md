We are currently developing a prototype tool for the World Health Organization
to aid the cities of Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal, to effectively plan
active transport futures. Examples of our tool in action can be seen in [this
interactive map of 'first mile' pedestrian flows from towards bus
stops](https://atfutures.github.io/accra-flows-ped-to-bus/index.html), and the
equivalent ['last mile' flows from bus
stops](https://atfutures.github.io/accra-flows-ped-from-bus/index.html). Those
are flows to and from every single point in the Accra street network
respectively from and to every single bus stop.

The project is developed as an entirely open and repeatable
[`github` repository](https://github.com/ATFutures/who), with the initial
report available
[here](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/who-active-travel-tool-feasibility/README.html).
