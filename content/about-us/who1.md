We are currently developing a prototype tool for the World Health Organization
to aid the cities of Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal, to effectively plan
active transport futures. The project is developed as an entirely open and repeatable
[`github` repository](https://github.com/ATFutures/who), with the initial
report available
[here](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/who-active-travel-tool-feasibility/README.html).
