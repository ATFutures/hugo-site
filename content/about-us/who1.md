Active Transport Futures Software is used by the World Health Organization (WHO)
as part of their [Urban Health
Initiative](http://www.who.int/topics/urban_health/en). An important focus for
the WHO is understanding how, when, where, and why people move throughout
cities.  We are currently developing a [prototype tool](http://35.233.61.182) to
aid the cities of Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal, to effectively plan active
transport futures. 

The tool is currently a prototype development platform only, and is intended to
demonstrate the technical feasibility of interactive viewing of multiple layers
representing aggregate movements throughout a city for different purposes and
using different modes of active transport (currently walking and cycling).

These patterns of movement are then linked with the WHO's [Health Economic
Assessment Tool](http://heatwalkingcycling.org/#homepage) to yield spatially,
demographically, and behaviourally explicit insight into the health and economic
impacts of current and project patterns of active transport.
