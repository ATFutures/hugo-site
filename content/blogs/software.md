Our primary software tools are developed as modular **R** packages, including:

1. [`osmdata`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmdata), a package for very
   efficient and flexible extraction of data from Open Street Map (OSM).
2. [`dodgr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dodgr) (**D**istances **o**n
   **D**irected **G**raphs in **R**), a package for highly efficient and
   scalable routing and allocation of aggregate flows on complex, dual-weighted
   graphs.
