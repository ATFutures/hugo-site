We presented our research at the UNESCO premises in Paris as part of a WHO meeting on *Tools on the impacts of air pollution and transport on health: WHO work and future developments*.

Instead of a static 'powerpoint' style presentation we presented a series of web pages which set-out the context surrounding and foundations of our 'Active Transport Toolkit' (ATT):

- [Data](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/9be4801670fcda033b48ca02e38a5ca9) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) portal showing the relationship between deaths from road traffic casualties and air polution in France and Ghana.
- Our [report](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/who-active-travel-tool-feasibility/README.html#references) for the WHO on the feasibility of an ATT for Accra and Kathmandu.
- An on-line [demonstration](http://www.pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire) of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT).
- A demonstration of the Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit ([CyIPT](https://www.cyipt.bike)).
- A link to a page of the ATFutures webpage with additional links on that project.
- An [interactive map](https://atfutures.github.io/accra-flows-ped-to-bus/index.html) showing estimated travel flows to bus stops in Accra, highlighting the potential of our tool to model multi-model journeys.
