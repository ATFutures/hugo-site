Transport planning software was originally designed to plan for motorised transport,
rapid growth in private car ownership and use in particular
(Boyce and Williams, [2015](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/forecasting-urban-travel)).
The latest scientific evidence shows that this type of planning is no longer sustainable.
From a **health perspective** over-reliance on motor vehicles is damaging:
active transport can transform lives by making physical activity part of everyday life
(Celis-Morales et al., [2017](http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1456)).
Furthermore, motorised transport is inefficient, typically expending more energy moving the 
vehicle than its passengers.
Active transport can help cities address related issues of road traffic deaths,
greenhouse gas emissions targets and air pollution.
